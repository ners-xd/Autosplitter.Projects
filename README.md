# LiveSplit Autosplitters by NERS
This is where I upload my LiveSplit autosplitters.
RPG Maker MV autosplitters use [samjones246's plugin](https://github.com/samjones246/rpgmmv-livesplit/blob/master/js/plugins/LiveSplit.js) so rename them to Autosplitter.json and put them in your game's folder.

I've also contributed to a couple of other people's autosplitters, namely:
- Tenebrosful's [DELTARUNE (GameMaker) autosplitter](https://github.com/Tenebrosful/DELTARUNE-Livesplit.Autosplitter);
- cccarl / SunglassesEmoji's [OneShot 2014/2016 (RPG Maker 2003/XP) autosplitter](https://github.com/cccarl/OneShot-ASL).
